        "content": "Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science and programming where a function calls itself directly or indirectly in order to solve a problem. This technique is used to break down complex problems into simpler, more manageable sub-problems. Each recursive call works on a smaller instance of the same problem, and the solution to the original problem is built up from the solutions to these smaller instances.\n\n### Key Components of Recursion\n\n1. **Base Case**: This is the condition under which the recursion stops. It prevents the function from calling itself indefinitely and eventually leads to a solution.\n2. **Recursive Case**: This is the part of the function where the function calls itself with a modified argument, moving towards the base case.\n\n### Example of Recursion\n\nA classic example of recursion is the calculation of the factorial of a number. The factorial of a non-negative integer \\( n \\) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \\( n \\). It is denoted by \\( n! \\).\n\nThe factorial function can be defined recursively as:\n- \\( 0! = 1 \\) (Base Case)\n- \\( n! = n \\times (n-1)! \\) (Recursive Case)\n\nHere is a simple implementation of the factorial function in TypeScript:\n\n```typescript\nfunction factorial(n: number): number {\n    // Base case: if n is 0, return 1\n    if (n === 0) {\n        return 1;\n    }\n    // Recursive case: n * factorial(n - 1)\n    return n * factorial(n - 1);\n}\n\n// Example usage\nconsole.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120\n```\n\n### How Recursion Works\n\nWhen `factorial(5)` is called, the following sequence of calls occurs:\n1. `factorial(5)` calls `factorial(4)`\n2. `factorial(4)` calls `factorial(3)`\n3. `factorial(3)` calls `factorial(2)`\n4. `factorial(2)` calls `factorial(1)`\n5. `factorial(1)` calls `factorial(0)`\n6. `factorial(0)` returns 1 (base case)\n7. `factorial(1)` returns `1 * 1 = 1`\n8. `factorial(2)` returns `2 * 1 = 2`\n9. `factorial(3)` returns `3 * 2 = 6`\n10. `factorial(4)` returns `4 * 6 = 24`\n11. `factorial(5)` returns `5 * 24 = 120`\n\n### Advantages and Disadvantages of Recursion\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Simplifies code for problems that have a natural recursive structure (e.g., tree traversal, factorial calculation).\n- Makes the code more readable and easier to understand for certain problems.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- Can lead to high memory usage due to the function call stack, especially for deep recursion.\n- May result in stack overflow if the base case is not reached or if the recursion is too deep.\n- Often less efficient than iterative solutions due to the overhead of multiple function calls.\n\nRecursion is a powerful tool in a programmer's toolkit, but it should be used judiciously, keeping in mind the problem's requirements and constraints.",
